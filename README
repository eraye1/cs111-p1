Notes:  
The first part parses the input into a char* buffer.
The second part takes the char* buffer and turns them into our tokens ("tokenization").  
    we use the MISC_TOKEN to detect bad inputs and then later we can use this to throw an exception or deal with bad inputs this way.

TODO:  Comments currently works, but if we get the character '#' inside a word, it treats it as a comments token.  Not sure if this is the intended behavior and the specs are unclear.
